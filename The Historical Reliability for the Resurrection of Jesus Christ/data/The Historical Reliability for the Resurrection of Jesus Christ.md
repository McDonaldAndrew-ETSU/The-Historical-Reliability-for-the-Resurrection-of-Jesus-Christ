This document presents a comprehensive exploration of the available evidence, both biblical and nonbiblical, for the historical reliability of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is written with the hope of encouraging readers to thoughtfully consider the evidence paired with its sources, should they wish to explore further.

# I. Questions for Reflection Before Reading
1. What are you living or motivated for?
2. What is the evidence that what you are living for is true?
3. Is there a Creator of the Universe?
	- If believed to be false, consider exploring these philosophical questions. Without a Creator, explore questions such as: How did the Universe originate? Who defines moral absolutes? Are all moral absolutes equally valid? Who determines their validity?
4. Was Jesus a real historical person? 
	- If believed to be false, refer to section **IV.2.** which examines non-biblical historical sources documenting Jesus from the Gospels as a historical figure.
5. Are there any other historically reliable sources outside the New Testament that describe the personal life of Jesus? 
	- If so, how do they compare in reliability to the Gospel accounts? For any questions about assessing the reliability of historical sources, refer to the methodology in **II.6**, which applies universally to all documents.

# II. Historical Reliability of the Gospels
## 1. Addressing Common Questions About the Gospels
### A. *Were the Gospels anonymously written?*
Almost every surviving gospel manuscript with a start or finish includes the traditional names (see **Fig. 1 - Manuscript P75**). Some manuscripts, like P1 (see **Fig. 2 - Manuscript P1**), begin with letters from the Greek alphabet to indicate pagination, rather than a centered title. Additional evidence comes from P4, containing a blank sheet of papyrus with the centered text "Gospel According to Matthew" (see **Fig. 3 - Manuscript P4**). This strongly supports its identification as a flyleaf, and although paired with fragments of Luke, it appears misplaced and likely belongs to lost manuscripts of Matthew. This provides evidence that flyleaves, like the one in P4, were originally paired with Greek-letter-paginated manuscripts such as P1. 
-  **Figure 1 - Manuscript P75**
	Here, the Greek ending *ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΚΑΤΑ ΛΟΥΚΑΝ* or *GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE* (Lucan) denoting the end of Luke. Additionally below, the Greek start *ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΚΑΤΑ ΙΩΑΝΝΗΝ* or *GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN*
	![[p75_end_of_Luke_beginning_of_John.png]]
- **Figure 2 - Manuscript P1**
	Here, the stylized Greek "a" is the first letter. The second image shows the very back of this papyrus, where one can just barely make out the Greek letter "b". This represents pagination. 
	![[p1_front.png]]
	![[p1_back.png]]
- **Figure 3 - Manuscript P4**
	Here, the centered Greek most likely forms "*ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΘΘΑΙΟΝ*" or "*GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW*" where the "*ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΘΘΑΙΟΝ*" are extremely fragmented. ![[p4_flyleaf_of_Matthew.png]]

The Gospels were never anonymous as their authorship was backed by manuscript evidence (see **II.2**) and strong and consistent attribution of authorship by the early Christian church (see sections **II.4** and **II.5**).
### B. *Were the Gospels invented or fabricated?*
If the gospels were to be invented or fabricated, attributing 'Peter' to Mark and 'James' to Luke would have been a more compelling and appealing choice as Mark was known to be a disciple of Peter and Luke was not originally one of Jesus's disciples (see **II.4.A**). 
- Mark was not an apostle and had abandoned Paul during the middle of their mission trip later causing dispute between Paul and Barnabas, separating them (see [Acts 13: 1-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013&version=NIV) and [Acts 15: 36-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015&version=NIV)).
	- Why attribute Mark, someone that brought animosity between Paul and Barnabas, two major leaders in spreading the Gospel, when the name of an eyewitness apostle Peter would have been far more compelling?
- Luke was a Gentile, a non-eyewitness of Jesus, and a companion of Paul. 
	- Why attribute an outsider when the name of an eyewitness apostle would have been far more compelling? 
	- Additionally, Luke had dedicated his Gospel account specifically for a "Theophilus" , so there was not a mystery to who wrote Luke's Gospel (see [Luke 1:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&version=NIV) and [Acts 1:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV)). 
- Matthew was a Jewish tax-collector for Rome, and seen as traitorous to other Jews (see [Matthew 9: 9-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209&version=NIV) and [Matthew 10:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010&version=NIV)). 
	- If fabricating Matthew's gospel, why use the name of a traitor? 
- If the goal were to boost credibility of fabricated Gospels, one would naturally choose prominent names, as evidenced by the apocryphal gospels (e.g., _The Gospel of Peter_, _The Gospel of Thomas_), which were not accepted by the early Christian church (see sections **II.4** and **II.5**).
### C. *Are the Gospels Less Historically Reliable Given Their Differences From One Another?*
It is uncommon for witnesses of the same event to agree on every detail including the smallest details. Perfect agreement can raise suspicion of dishonesty or collaboration. For example, if we are only given two accounts.
- Example:
	Imagine two witnesses describing a famous speech by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington. One witness says, "*He was wearing a **dark** suit, and the crowd erupted in applause when he said '**I have a dream**.'*" The other says, "*He wore a **black** suit, and people cheered loudly after he said '**I have a dream today**.'*"
	The slight differences calling the suit "dark" versus "black" and phrasing of the "I have a dream" seem natural and reflect individual perceptions. If instead, both witnesses gave identical accounts, down to every word and detail, like, "*Dr. King wore a black suit and the crowd erupted in applause exactly when he said 'I have a dream today.'*", it might feel rehearsed or suspicious, as real-life memory usually is not that perfect.
- In courts of law, two accounts of an event do not need to be perfectly identical for them both to be true.
### D. *Were the Gospel Writers Exchanging Ideas or Copying Another's Work?*
If Mark's Gospel is based on the testimony of Peter (see **II.4.A**), there's nothing remotely implausible about Matthew using it as a source for his account. Matthew could have relied on this source especially for any events at which Matthew himself was not present, such as the early days of Jesus's ministry (see [Matthew 3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203&version=NIV)) or the events of Jesus's passion and death, which Matthew did not witness because he had fled the scene (see [Matthew 26-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026&version=NIV)).

History gives us other examples of eyewitnesses who relied on other people's testimony when composing biographies of their own teachers. For example,
- When writing his account of the death of Socrates, the ancient Greek writer Xenophon (who was a disciple of Socrates) used the "reports" (Greek exengelle) of another disciple named Hermogenes (see [Xenophon Apology, 1.2](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0212)). 
- The reason was that Xenophon was not present at the trial and death of Socrates, whereas Hermogenes was.
### E. *Have the Gospels Been Translated and Retranslated So Many Times That We Do Not Know What They Originally Said?*
As of writing this document, there are over 5,800 Greek New Testament manuscripts according to the *Kurzgefasste Liste der griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments* (or the 'Concise List of Greek Manuscripts of the New Testament'; abbreviated as _K-Liste_ or _Liste_; see [K-Liste](https://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/manuscript-catalog)). Of these 5,800 manuscripts, the Gospels contain the majority of these at over 2,400. Scholars such as Daniel Wallace, founder of the CSNTM, have meticulously analyzed thousands of the oldest Greek manuscript copies, and found that the overwhelming majority of textual variations are minor, often involving spelling differences or word order, with no significant impact on meaning (see [Daniel Wallace's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5cgQUJnrI)). Key evidence includes:
- **Foundation of Today's New Testament Gospels**
	- These original and oldest Greek manuscripts serve as the foundation for today's New Testament Gospels.
		- "The Greek text used in translating the New Testament is an eclectic one, based on the latest editions of the Nestle-Aland/United Bible Societies’ Greek New Testament" (see [Biblia, Preface (NIV)](https://biblia.com/books/niv2011/Ge))
		- The latest editions of both the Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece and United Bible Societies’ Greek New Testament is based on all available original Greek manuscript evidence (see [NA27.II.1](https://archive.org/details/nestle-aland/page/n33/mode/2up), [NA28.II.1](https://archive.org/details/ntg-28-nestle-aland-institute-for-new-testament-textual-research/page/n69/mode/2up), and [UBS5.II](https://archive.org/details/novum-testamentum-graece-nestle-aland-28-ed.-pdfdrive/The%20Greek%20New%20Testament%20UBS%20Fifth%20Revised%20Edition/page/n31/mode/2up))  
- **The Uniformity of Textual Content Across Manuscripts:**
    - Manuscripts such as the 4th century Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus exhibit extraordinary consistency with earlier papyri fragments like the 2nd-3rd century P75 (see **II.2.A** and **VII.1.B.a-b**). 
    - Compare Luke 24:36-39 from P75 to today's NIV (see **II.2.A** and [Luke 24: 36-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV)):
	    - 36: *του· ταυτα δε αυτων λαλουντων. αυτος*
	    - "While they were still talking about this, he himself"
	    - *εστη εν μεσω αυτων και λεγει αυτοις* ειρηνη υμιν θροη 
	    - "stood in the middle of them and says to them, 'peace be upon you' "
	    - 37: *θεντες δε και εμ φοβοι γενομενοι εδοκουν πνα θεωρειν·*
	    - "being startled and becoming afraid, they were thinking they saw a spirit."
	    - 38: *και ειπεν αυτοις τι τεταραγμενοι εστε· και τι διαλογισμοι αναβαινουσιν εν τη  καρδια υμων·* 
	    - "and he said to them, 'Why are you troubled; And why do doubts arise in your hearts?' "
	    - 39: *ιδετε τας χειρας μου και τους ποδας οτι εγω ειμι αυτος·*
	    - " 'see my hands and my feet that I am myself' ""
	    - *ψη̣λαφησατε με και ιδετε οτι πνα σαρκας και οστεα ουκ εχει καθως εμε θεωρειτε  εχοντα·*
	    - " 'touch me and see that a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me having' ".
	- This demonstrates that the Gospels exhibit a remarkable level of consistency in meaning, and structure, affirming their faithful preservation and reliability over centuries.
- **Quotations by Early Church Fathers:**
	- Early Christian writers, including **Ignatius of Antioch** around 110 AD and **Justin Martyr** around 2nd century, quoted extensively from the Gospels (see **II.5.C** and **II.5.E**). 
		- These quotations match the oldest Greek manuscripts available and confirm the accuracy of today's Gospel texts long before the earliest surviving complete copies.
## 2. Oldest Gospel Manuscripts
The following sections analyze the ancient New Testament manuscripts from the CSNTM (see [The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts](https://manuscripts.csntm.org/)).
### A. Bodmer Papyri (middle 100's to early 200's AD)

	- ![[p52_fragment.png|250]]
## 3. When were Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John Written?
### A. Scholarly Accepted Dates of the Gospel Account
Most scholars state that the gospels were written as follows:
- Mark ~ 70 AD
- Matthew ~ 80 AD
- Luke ~ 85 AD
- John ~ 90-95 AD
#### a. Methodology
Scholars date these **so late** for one primary reason:
- Jesus's specific prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple which had happened in 70 AD (see [Matthew 24: 1-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024&version=NIV), [Mark 13: 1-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2013&version=NIV), [Luke 21:5-6, 20-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2021&version=NIV), and [John 2: 19-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202&version=NIV))
	- Jesus is also revealing to His audience that history is about to repeat itself, as Jerusalem was already destroyed by Babylon in 586 BC (see [2 Kings 25:8-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%2025&version=NIV))
#### b. Exposing the Anti-Prophetic Theory
The *Anti-Prophetic* theory claims that Jesus could have never prophesied the coming devastation of Jerusalem in such great detail.
- If the Gospels *were* written in the scholarly accepted dates, the destruction of Jerusalem would have had already happened in 70 AD. 
	- Why would Matthew or Mark add for his audience to pray that the desolation would not take place on the sabbath (see [Matthew 24: 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024&version=NIV)) or in winter (see [Mark 13: 18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2013&version=NIV)) if the destruction happened in the Summer after a traditional Jewish sabbath?
	- Why would Luke add a warning for his audience not to enter into the city if the city was already destroyed (see [Luke 21: 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2021&version=NIV))? 
	**This does not make any sense for anyone reading the documents at the proposed dates**, and the early Christian church would have easily caught and denied these as fake accounts (see sections **II.4** and **II.5**).
### B. Evidence: Likely Dating of the Gospel Accounts
#### a. Was Luke Written before 64 AD?
- ##### Absence of Fulfillment of the Destruction of Jerusalem from Jesus's Prophecy
	Why didn't Luke say Jesus's words about the destruction of Jerusalem's Temple were fulfilled in the days of Emperor Titus?
	- It is evident the fulfillment **had not happened yet** (see [Luke 21-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2021&version=NIV)).
- ##### Absence of Paul's Death in Acts 
	Due to the Gallio archeological finding (see [The Gallio Inscription](https://www.bibleplaces.com/acts18/)) we can date Paul's last letter ([2 Timothy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201&version=NIV)) to shortly before his death while he was under trial, during the reign of Roman Emperor Nero's great Christian Persecution (see **III.2.A**)
	- Luke does not mention Paul's death even though the evidence supports he was Paul's travel companion throughout his journeys (see [Acts](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV)).
	- **Acts 20 - Acts 28** follows closely the progress of Paul's trial. The narrative then abruptly ends before the trial even happens (see [Acts 20-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020&version=NIV)).
		- This is unlike Luke, giving great detail about Jesus's trial and Paul's sufferings before his death. Why would he not detail the events of Paul's trial? **The evidence supports that the trial had not happened yet dating Acts before 64 AD and before the conclusion of Paul's trial**. Paul's death had not happened yet in the time of finishing Acts (see [Acts 28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2028&version=NIV)).
- ##### Paul Quotes Gospel of Luke Considering it Scripture
	Paul quotes Luke in his first Epistle to Timothy (see [1 Timothy 5:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%205&version=NIV), [Luke 10:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010&version=NIV))
	- Paul's letter to Timothy shows that Luke was written **before Paul's death around 64 AD**.
- ##### Absence of the Late 1st Century's Major Historical Events
	Luke details the well known famine in Jerusalem prophesied by the prophet Agabus, which was fulfilled in the 40's AD (see [Acts 11:27-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2011&version=NIV)), as well as the expulsion of Jews from Emperor Claudius (see [Acts 18: 1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018&version=NIV)). However, Luke has nothing to say about:
	- Mass Christian Persecution of Christian in Rome in 64 AD
	- The Jewish rebellion in 66 AD
	- The Jerusalem Temple's destruction in 70 AD
- ##### Absence of Deaths of Those Luke Came In Contact With
	Luke notes the death of Stephen, not a member of the 12 (see [Acts 7: 54-60](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207&version=NIV)), as well as the martyrdom of James the son of Zebedee (see [Acts 12: 1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012&version=NIV)). However, Luke has nothing to say about:
	- Nero's Persecution of Christian in Rome in 64 AD.
	- The death of James the brother of Jesus (see **section III.1.A**) even though in **Acts** he states how James the brother of Jesus is a prominent member in the Jerusalem church (see [Acts 12:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012&version=NIV), [Acts 15:13-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015&version=NIV), and [Acts 21:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2021&version=NIV)).
	- Peter's execution, even though it is mentioned in the gospel of **John** (see [John 21:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2021&version=NIV)).
#### b. What About the Gospel of Matthew?
Irenaeus states: "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the church" (see [Against Heresies.III.1.1](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103301.htm)). Because of the Gallio inscription in 51-52 AD, Paul's preaching at Rome was before 51-52 AD, as Paul was brought in under arrest under the jurisdiction of Proconsul of Achaia, Gallio (see [Acts 18: 12-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018&version=NIV) and [The Gallio Inscription](https://www.bibleplaces.com/acts18/)).
#### c. What About the Gospel of Mark?
It is evident that Matthew likely had used Mark's Gospel as a reference, and if Matthew was likely written before 51-52 AD (see **section II.3.B.b**), then Mark also was likely written before 51-52 AD.
#### d. What About the Gospel of John?
- ##### Note of Peter's Future Martyrdom
	- John writes that after Jesus's resurrection, Jesus prophesies a warning to the disciples and John relates it to the death Peter will suffer (see [John 21:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2021&version=NIV)).
		- Peter's death was likely during the mass Christian Persecution under Roman Emperor Nero sometime between 64 AD and 68 AD (Nero's death), as Peter was known to be in Rome during this time by the early Christian church fathers.
			- Ignatius of Antioch in the early 2nd century, writes to the Roman Christian Church that he could not issue commandments the way Peter and Paul once did (see [Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Romans.4](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0107.htm))
			- Irenaeus of Lyons in the late 2nd century wrote that Matthew wrote his Gospel while Peter and Paul were laying the foundation of the church in Rome (see [Irenaeus, Against Heresies.III.1.1](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103301.htm))
			- Tertullian of Carthage in the late 2nd century makes note of the Roman church affiliating it with Peter's martyrdom (see [Tertullian of Carthage, The Prescription Against the Heretics.36](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm)).
		- In the original Greek, John uses *δοξάσει* meaning "He will glorify" speaking in the future tense suggesting it was written before Peter's martyrdom.
- ##### Present Tense of Describing Jerusalem Before its Destruction
	- John repeatedly describes different historical and geographical details throughout the ancient Palestine in the present tense, including details of Jerusalem as though the city still stood, prior to its fall in 70 AD.
		- John notes the location of the Pool of Bethesda and its 5 covered colonnades as if it was present at the time of his writing (see [John 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205&version=NIV))
		- John notes the location of a place called Gabbatha in Aramaic, noting also its Greek name of The Stone Pavement, as if it was present at the time of his writing (see [John 19:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV))
#### e. Conclusion: Likely Dating of the Gospel Accounts 
With the described evidence, one can conclude **Acts** was likely written before 64 AD. Luke wrote **Acts** sometime *after* his own Gospel (**Luke**). If **Luke** possibly used the Gospels of **Matthew** and **Mark**, that means they were written before the Gospel of **Luke**. John was likely written after the other Gospel accounts, but noting the death of Peter with the present tense of Jerusalem suggests that he wrote in between these two events. Therefore, the likely dates of when the gospels were written are as follows:
- Matthew ***<*** 64 AD (potentially < 51-52 AD; see **II.3.B.b**)
- Mark ***<*** 64 AD (potentially< 51-52 AD; see **II.3.B.c)
- Luke ***<*** 64 AD
- John **~** 64-70 AD  
## 4. Testimonies and Relentlessness of Authenticity From the Early Christian Church on Who Wrote the Gospels
The early Christian church fathers universally acknowledged the four named Gospels as being written by their respective names. If the Gospels were anonymous, it is not reasonable to assume them circulating around the Roman Empire for almost 100 years could somehow at some point be attributed to exactly the same authors by scribes throughout the world during the 1st and 2nd centuries. This argument is exemplified as there existed significant debate as to who wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews among the early Church fathers (see [Clement of Alexandria's Fragments - Comments On the First Epistle of Peter](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0211.htm), [Eusebius of Caesarea's Church History.3.3, 6.14, 6.20, 6.25](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2501.htm), [Tertullian of Carthage's On Modesty.20](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0407.htm)). There existed no debate regarding the authorship of the four Gospels among the early Christian church, unlike their debates regarding other writings, such as the Letter to the Hebrews.
### A. Writings from the Early Christian Church Fathers 
#### a. Papius of Hierapolis (Asia Minor/Turkey | 100-125 AD)
Wrote:
- "Mark, having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately, though not in order, whatsoever he remembered of the things said or done by Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor followed him, but afterwards, as I said, followed Peter, who adapted his teaching to the needs of his hearers, but with no intention of giving a connected account of the Lord's discourses, so that Mark committed no error while he this wrote some things as he remembered them. For he was careful of one thing, not to omit any of the things which he had heard, and not to state any of them falsely."
	- Mark was Peter's interpreter and wrote down what Peter had preached, but not in chronological order (see [Eusebius of Caesarea's Church History.III.39.15](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm)).
- "So then Matthew wrote the oracles in the Hebrew language, and everyone interpreted them as he was able."
	- Matthew initially compiled Jesus's sayings in "Hebrew (or Aramaic) dialect" (see [Eusebius of Caesarea's Church History.III.39.16](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm)).
#### b. Justin Martyr (Rome | 155 AD)
- "For the apostles, in the memoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels, have this delivered unto us what was enjoined upon them..." (see [Justin Martyr of Rome, First Apology.66](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm)).
- Writes that these memoirs were drawn up by the apostles of Jesus and those who followed them (see [Justin Martyr of Rome, Dailogue with Trypho.103](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/01287.htm)).
- His student **Tation** that wrote the the 4 Gospels together titled the **Diatessaron**, meaning "Through four" (see [Eusebius of Caesarea's Church History.IV.29.6](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250104.htm)).
#### c. Muratorian Canon Fragment (Rome | 170 AD) 
A fragment containing the list of New Testament books and additionally denouncing some Christians and writings due to their Gnostic teachings. The fragment is currently held in Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, Italy. (see [The Muratorian Fragment](https://archive.org/details/cu31924091353528/page/n43/mode/2up?) and [its pdf translation](MuratorianFragment.pdf))
Wrote:
- It names Luke as Paul's companion
- It names Luke as the author of the 3rd Gospel as well as Acts
- It names John as the author of the 4th Gospel.
- Rejection of False/Forged Epistle to the Alexandrians and Laodiceans that was not truly of Paul
- Heretics such as Marcion, Valentinus, and Basilides are rejected for promoting doctrines contrary to the faith through forged writings designed to support their teachings.
- The Church rejects non-apostolic and non-prophetic writings (e.g., "The Shepherd" by Hermas) for public reading in churches, emphasizing the inclusion of the prophetic and apostolic tradition​
#### d. Irenaeus of Lyons (Gaul/France | 180 AD)
Wrote:
- "So Matthew brought out a written gospel among the Jews in their own style, when Peter and Paul were preaching the gospel at Rome and founding the church. But after their demise Mark himself, the disciple and recorder of Peter, has also handed on to us in writing what had been proclaimed by Peter. And Luke, the follower of Paul, set forth in a book the gospel that was proclaimed by him. Later John, the disciple of the Lord and the one who leaned against his chest, also put out a Gospel while residing in Ephesus of Asia." (see [Irenaeus of Lyons, Against Heresies 3.1.1](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103301.htm)).
	- Explicitly states that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are the authors of their Gospels.
- Names the Gospels the early Church's "four pillars" (see [Irenaeus of Lyons, Against Heresies 3.11.8](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103311.htm))
- Additionally cites the conclusion of Mark (see [Irenaeus of Lyons, Against Heresies 3.10.5](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103310.htm)).
#### e. Clement of Alexandria (Egypt | 180 AD)
Wrote:
- "Mark, the follower of Peter, while Peter was publicly preaching the gospel at Rome in the presence of some of Caesar's knights and uttering many testimonies about Christ, on their asking him to let them have a record of the things that had been said, wrote the Gospel that is called the Gospel of Mark from the things said by Peter, just as Luke is recognized as the pen that wrote the Acts of the Apostles and as the translator of the Letter of Paul to the Hebrews." (see [Clement of Alexandria's Fragments - Comments On the First Epistle of Peter](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0211.htm)).
	- Confirmation on Mark writing down Peter's teachings
	- Linked Luke to the apostle Paul
#### f. Tertullian of Carthage (Tunisia | 208 AD)
Wrote:
- "We lay it down as our first position, that the evangelical Testament has apostles for its authors, to whom was assigned by the Lord Himself this office of publishing the gospel. Since, however, there are apostolic men also, they are yet not alone, but appear with apostles and after apostles; because the preaching of disciples might be open to the suspicion of an affectation of glory, if there did not accompany it the authority of the masters, which means that of Christ, for it was that which made the apostles their masters. Of the apostles, therefore, John and Matthew first instill faith into us; while of apostolic men, Luke and Mark renew it afterwards." (see [Tertullian of Carthage, Against Marcion 4.2](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/03124.htm)).
	- Defended the 4 main Gospels, while rejecting heretical knockoffs without apostolic ties (see [Tertullian of Carthage, Against Marcion 4.2-5](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/03124.htm)).
	- Mocking of Marcion's Anonymous Gospel - "A work ought not to be recognized, which holds not its head erect, which gives no proof of its identity, which affords no evidence of its authorship." (see [Tertullian of Carthage, Against Marcion 4.4](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/03124.htm)).
	- Criticizes the **Acts of Paul and Thecla** specifically stating that the author of the text was a presbyter who created it out of love for the Apostle Paul. The presbyter was defrocked (or kicked out) for having forged this work (see [Tertullian of Carthage, On Baptism](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0321.htm)).
#### g. Sarapion of Antioch (Syria | 199-211 AD)
Rejected the Gospel of Peter for falsely using Peter's name (see [Eusebius of Caesarea's Church History.6.12](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm))
#### h. Origen of Alexandria (Egypt | 248-250 AD)
Recognized and defended the apostolic origins of the four canonical Gospels and contrasts them with heretical texts. He emphasizes that:
- Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were universally recognized by the ancient early Church 125 or so years before Origen's writing (see [Origen of Alexandria, Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/101601.htm)).
- Refuted Celsus' and dismissed heretical gospels as fabricated works lacking credibility (see [Origen of Alexandria, Contra Celsum](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0416.htm)).
#### i. Celsus the Philosopher (Gaul/France | 248 AD)
Celsus the Heretic wrote: "The disciples of Jesus, having no undoubted fact on which to rely, devised the fiction that he foreknew everything before it happened..." (see [Origen of Alexandria, Contra Celsum 2.15](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04162.htm)). "The disciples of Jesus wrote such accounts regarding him, by way of extenuating the charges told against him..." (see [Origen of Alexandria, Contra Celsum 2.16](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04162.htm)).
- Notice that Celsus is not saying that no one knows who wrote the gospels. He knows the disciples of Jesus wrote the gospels, but claims that they just *lied* about it.
### B. Geographical Map of the Universal Early Christian Church
Shown here are the early Church fathers mentioned earlier according to their approximate location.

## 5. Use of Gospels Within the Early Christian Church
These writings show the early usage of the Gospels as Scripture across the early Christian church. The authors of these writings are part of the early Christian church and distinct from those mentioned in section **II.4**. Next to each of these item's names are the item's location and the time that they are dated to (e.g. Place | e.g 000 - 999 AD)
### A. Didache (Syria | 80-90 AD)
A document serving as a manual offering practical guidance on Christian ethics, worship, and community life (see [Didache.1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm)). Its sections parallel verses found in Matthew, Luke, and the Epistles of Paul:
### B. Clement of Rome (Rome | 96 AD)
Clement of Rome writes to the Corinthian church to address divisions and urges unity, humility, and obedience to God’s established order and uses the teachings of Jesus from the Gospels (see [Clement of Rome, Letter to the Corinthians.24, 27](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1010.htm)). Clement of Rome:
- References Jesus's parable of the Sower from Luke (see [Luke 8:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208&version=NIV)) to illustrate the certainty of Jesus's resurrection.
- References Jesus's words in Matthew, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away" (see [Matthew 24:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024&version=NIV)), to highlight the eternal and reliable nature of God's word.
### C. Ignatius of Antioch (Syria | 110 AD)
Wrote to the Smyrnaean's (see [Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrnaean's](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm)) on how he believed Jesus resurrected and was in the flesh, likely learned from Luke and John (see [Luke 24: 33-53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV) and [John 20-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2021&version=NIV))
### D. Polycarp of Smyrna (Asia Minor/Turkey | 110-140 AD)
Wrote a letter to the church at Philippi (see [Polycarp of Smyrna, Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0136.htm)) quoting Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts, and Epistles of Paul and John which shows treating of them as Scripture early.
### E. Justin Martyr (Rome | 155-165 AD)
Wrote a formal defense of Christianity addressed to Emperor Antoninus Pius, his sons, and the Roman Senate aiming to counter misconceptions about Christians and to argue for the rational and moral superiority of Christianity (see [Justin Martyr of Rome, First Apology.15](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm))
- In these chapters, he quotes from and references all four gospels extensively. Some few examples are:
	- In chapter 15, he cites Jesus's words on Treasures in Heaven and Do Not Worry (see [Matthew 6:19-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206&version=NIV)).
	- In chapter 16, he cites Jesus's words on The Greatest Commandment (see [Mark 12:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012&version=NIV))
	- In chapter 66, he cites Jesus's words during the Last Supper (see [Luke 22:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022&version=NIV))
	- In chapter 61, he cites Jesus's words when meeting with Nicodemus (see [John 3:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203&version=NIV))

## 6. Testing the Historicity of the Gospels
Tests must be created in order to be used for any document that claims to be historical. Their goal should be to carefully and fairly examine historical documents to uncover unbiased truth. These tests are listed below
1. **Literary Style**: Is the literary style of the document fairytale such as "Once upon a time, in the land of Narnia", or is it historical narrative including high witness reporting, i.e. "At this time, at this place, with these people around"?
2. **Internal Consistency**: Are there contradictions within the text that point to massive confusion on the part of the author?
	- Universal, Divergent, and Perspective details from documents, not contradicting one another, but containing different details note authenticity on the part of the authors.
	- Multiple historical perspectives help a historical claim's accuracy.
3. **Archeological Evidence**: Does the document state for example "Augusto floated a boat 100 cubits above the city of Atlantis?" or does the document contain specific and hard details of specific people and geographical landmarks or places that can be historically verified that others in the time and place otherwise would not know if they had not observed these in that time?
4. **Manuscript Evidence**: Do older documents compared with much later copies of them agree with only infinitesimal differences? Meaning, the differences between manuscripts are extremely small and unimportant, proving that despite massive gaps of time, the manuscripts are overwhelmingly consistent with one another.
### A. Testing the Historicity of the Spider-Man Novels
Here is an example of using these tests on Spider-Man novels if found 2000 years into the future: 
**Literary Style - FAIL**
The documents of Spiderman do not represent historical eyewitness-style reporting, but more so of story telling.
**Internal Consistency - FAIL**
While the internal consistency may be strong within short arcs, the larger canon contains purposeful contradictions (i.e. specific arcs, series, intentional reboots, or alternate timelines) that indicate a fictional and evolving story, rather than a single, unified historical narrative.
**Archeological Evidence - FAIL**
Archeologists 2000 years into the future would find no other historical evidence of people named "Green Goblin" or "Doctor Octopus" as well as no corporations with hundreds of workers like "Oscorp" or the "Daily Bugle".
**Manuscript Evidence - FAIL**
While there might be remarkable consistency in certain elements of Spider-Man’s story, the changes across time would indicate a work of fiction rather than an attempt to document real events. For example, take a look at first issues of *The Amazing Spider-Man* from 1963, and compare it to *Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man* from 2011. Both documents include a character named Spider-Man who has great powers, but one is named Peter Parker and the other is Miles Morales! Both of which also have drastically different origin stories and cultural settings.
### B. Testing the Historicity of Martin Luther King Jr's Speeches and Letters
Here is an example of using these tests on Martin Luther King Jr's speeches and letters if found 2000 years into the future: 
**Literary Style - PASS**
The style of MLK Jr.’s speeches and letters, such as the "I Have a Dream" speech or "Letter from Birmingham Jail," is firmly rooted in historical narrative and persuasive argumentation. These documents reference real events, people, and struggles of the Civil Rights Movement in 20th-century America. 
**Internal Consistency - PASS**
Across King’s speeches and letters, there is a remarkable consistency in themes and messages. He consistently advocates for nonviolence, racial equality, and justice. Any potential divergences (such as minor wording differences between recordings and manuscript transcriptions) would enhance their authenticity rather than detract from it.
**Archeological Evidence - PASS**
Archeologists 2000 years into the future could uncover physical evidence of King’s speeches and letters provide detailed references to real, verifiable events, locations, monuments, jail records, news articles, and preserved media from the 20th century, firmly grounding them in historical reality.
**Manuscript Evidence - PASS**
King’s letters and speeches have been preserved with numerous written manuscripts, audio recordings, and video footage. Comparing early drafts to the latest draft we have today reveals overwhelming consistency. Minor differences (e.g., editorial choices) would be insignificant to the overall meaning and content.
### C. Testing the Historicity of the Gospels
Given these tests and their application to the previous examples, this section implores the reader to use these tests on the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John to evaluate their historical reliability. If these particular tests are deemed insufficient, alternative criteria should be developed to rigorously assess the authenticity of any document. The goal of these tests should remain to be the careful and fair examination of historical texts to uncover unbiased truth.

# III. Were the Apostles Truly Martyred?
The Disciples passed their lives in labors, dangers, and sufferings, voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered, and solely in consequence of their accounts. The early Christian church was under heavy persecution and the apostles knew that suffering and death were around every corner for them, but that didn't stop them from spreading what they had seen (see [Acts](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV)). They rejoiced in knowing that suffering and death were around the corner for them. This section documents below that the execution of Christians happened because they either were Christians or did not renounce their Christian faith.

Non-Christian sources like Josephus, Tacitus, and Suetonius provide indirect or circumstantial evidence for the persecution and deaths of early Christians. While these sources rarely name individuals beyond James the brother of Jesus, they corroborate the historical reality of violence and persecution from both the Jews and Romans against the early Christian figures and communities.
## 1. Josephus on James the Brother of Jesus | 92-93 AD
Josephus the Jewish Historian writes how James the brother of Jesus Christ is killed by the High Priest Ananus unjustifiably.
- "...brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned..." (see [Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 20.197-202](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D20%3Asection%3D197)).
- This demonstrates the sincerity of those who witnessed Jesus's resurrection, as they were unafraid to tell the news of what they had seen.
- This accredits historical reliability to the Gospels stating that the Sadducees and Pharisees unjustly gave anyone charges they deemed a nuisance.
## 2. Pliny the Younger | 110-113 AD
In his letters to Emperor Trajan, Pliny describes interrogating Christians in Bithynia. While he does not name specific apostles or disciples, he notes that some Christians were executed for refusing to renounce their faith. This aligns with broader traditions of martyrdom involving early Christian leaders (see [Letters 10.96-97](Pliny.pdf)).
## 3. Suetonius on Christian Persecutions | 121 AD
While Suetonius does not describe the deaths of specific Apostles or disciples, he notes the expulsion of Christians from Rome under Claudius and Nero's persecution of Christians. His account of Nero’s reign reflects the widespread persecution and execution of Christian leaders, including likely some of the apostles (see [The Lives of the Caesars.Claudius 25.4](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Suet.+Cl.+25+4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132#note4) and [The Lives of the Caesars.Nero 16.2](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132%3Alife%3Dnero%3Achapter%3D16)).
## 4. Lucian of Samosata | 165 AD
A 2nd-century satirist, mocks Christians for their reverence of martyrs and willingness to die for their faith. While Lucian does not mention specific apostles, his account reflects the widespread persecution and execution of Christian leaders, including likely some of the apostles (see [The Passing of Peregrinus.11-14](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg042.perseus-eng4:11-14?q=burn&qk=form)).

# IV. Evidence: Crucifixion and Death of Jesus Christ
## 1. Idea of Crucifying the Jewish Messiah
It was an extremely offensive idea of a crucified messiah to 1st-century Jews. No law-observing Jew would have made up the idea of a crucified messiah. If any non-religious Jews existed, they likely would not imagine this due the punishment they may receive. We can conclude this by the writings of the Old Testament Law (see [Deuteronomy 13:1–5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2013&version=NIV) , [Deuteronomy 18:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2018&version=NIV),  [Leviticus 24:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2024&version=NIV)), the Talmud (see [Talmud, Sanhedrin 90a–99a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.90a?lang=bi)), and Jewish historians such as Josephus.
## 2. Non-Biblical Writings of Jesus Christ's Existence and Death
These sources, while often hostile or skeptical toward Jesus or early Christians, collectively provide external evidence for the historical existence of Jesus , his wonderful works, and the early spread of Christianity.
### A. Josephus on Jesus | 92-93 AD
- Josephus identifies Jesus as a "doer" of "wonderful works" and that he had many followers (see see [Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 18.63](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=J.+AJ+18.+63&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146) ).
- "...and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James..." (see [Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 20.197](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D20%3Asection%3D197)).
	- No controversy to this statement among any historian, as Josephus is directly connecting James to his brother Jesus Christ.
### B. The Annals & The Histories, Tacitus | 116 AD
8yrs after Tacitus' birth 64 AD a fire broke out in Rome and the Roman people blamed Emperor Nero, who then placed the blame on Christians in Rome, Tacitus had access to talk to about these events and Rome's official records being in several government positions, making his writings reliable. He has access to the Roman Senate's archives as he cites them twice. Any information regarding Jesus' Crucifixion would have been found in these archives.
- Nero blamed Christians for the Great Fire of Rome, subjecting them to brutal persecution, and Tacitus records that their name originated from Christus (Jesus), who was executed under Pontius Pilate during Tiberius's reign, yet their movement spread rapidly despite being briefly suppressed (see [Tacitus, Annals 15.44](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D44)).
### C. Pliny the Younger | 112 AD
Pliny was a Roman governor and lawyer who wrote to Emperor Trajan around 112 AD about how to deal with Christians in his province of Bithynia-Pontus (modern Turkey). In his letters, he describes early Christians worshiping Christ "as to a god." While Pliny does not provide a direct account of Jesus' life, his testimony confirms the existence of a group devoted to Christ in the early 2nd century (see [Pliny the Younger, Letters 10.96-97](Pliny.pdf)).
### D. Suetonius | 121 AD
Suetonius was a Roman historian who  mentioned disturbances caused by "Chrestus" in Rome during the reign of Emperor Claudius (41–54 AD). Suetonius writes that Claudius expelled Jews from Rome because of riots "at the instigation of Chrestus." This likely refers to early Christian disputes in Rome. While the name "Chrestus" may be a misspelling of "Christus". Suetonius' account indicates an awareness of Christ-associated tensions (see [Seutonius, The Lives of the Caesars.Claudius 25.4](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Suet.+Cl.+25+4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132#note4)).
### E. Lucian of Samosata | 165 AD
Lucian was a Greek satirist who mentioned Christians and their worship of a crucified figure in his work. He mocks Christians for their devotion to "the man who was crucified in Palestine" and criticizes their belief in immortality. While hostile, Lucian’s account corroborates the existence of Christians and their belief in Jesus' crucifixion (see [Lucian of Samasata, The Passing of Peregrinus.11](https://scaife.perseus.org/reader/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0062.tlg042.perseus-eng4:11?q=burn&qk=form)).
### F. Mara Bar-Serapion | 1st–2nd century AD
Mara Bar-Serapion was a Stoic philosopher who wrote a letter to his son likely in the late 1st or early 2nd century CE, referencing the execution of a "wise king" of the Jews. Many scholars interpret this as a reference to Jesus, although it is not explicit. Mara notes that after the execution of this figure, the Jewish people faced misfortune, which could align with later Roman conflicts (see [Mara Bar-Serapion, A Letter of Mara, Son of Serapion](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0863.htm)).
### G. Celsus the Philosopher | 248 AD
Celsus, a Greek philosopher, wrote a polemical critique of Christianity. Celsus references Jesus as a magician and illegitimate child. Though critical, his writings confirm that Jesus was a known figure (see [Origen of Alexandria, Contra Celsum 1.28-32](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/04161.htm)).
### H. The Talmud | 5th-7th centuries AD
The Jewish Talmud contains references to a Jesus the Nazarene. It mentions his execution on the eve of Passover for "sorcery" and leading Israel into apostasy. While not complimentary, this reference aligns with Christian accounts of Jesus' crucifixion and his perceived challenge to Jewish law. (see [Talmud, Sanhedrin 43a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.43a?lang=bi))

# V. Evidence: The Empty-Tomb and Resurrection of Jesus Christ
The following evidence expands on the acronym ALIVE borrowed from Tim and Lydia McGrew. ALIVE demonstrates how and why the resurrection of Jesus Christ is historically reliable, and not a blindly accepted belief.
## 1. **A**ppearances of Jesus After His Resurrection
The risen Jesus is recorded as appearing in Judea, Galilee, in and out of town, indoors, outdoors, morning, evening, close and distant, on a hill by a lake, to groups of men and groups of women, to individuals and in groups of up to 500, sitting, standing, walking, eating, and always talking. (see [Matthew 28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV), [Mark 16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016&version=NIV), [Luke 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV), and [John 20-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020-21&version=NIV))
### A. Disciples Witness the Risen Jesus After His Crucifixion and Burial
1. Thomas had open skepticism from the other disciple's accounts and Matthew states that more than one Disciple doubted even after seeing Jesus in the flesh (see [John 20:24-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020&version=NIV) and [Matthew 28:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV)).
2. Visions/Hallucinations were non-expectant due to disciples fleeing out of fear upon Jesus' arrest and were hiding in fear of persecution after Jesus's death (see [Matthew 26:56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026&version=NIV), [Mark 14:50](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014&version=NIV), [John 20:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020&version=NIV)) They were not expecting Jesus to rise from the dead, as evidenced by:
	- Their disbelief of the women’s testimony about the empty tomb ([Luke 24:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV) and [John 20:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020&version=NIV)).
	- Their initial assumption that Jesus was a ghost when He appeared to them ([Luke 24:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV)).
	- Hallucinations typically occur in people who have an intense expectation or longing for a specific outcome (e.g., seeing a loved one alive again). The disciples’ state of fear, doubt, and confusion makes hallucinations unlikely.
3.  Public, Multisensory, Extended Across across a period of 40 days (see [Matthew 28:9-10, 16-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV), [Luke 24:13-53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV), [John 20: 19-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020&version=NIV), and [1 Corinthians 15:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015&version=NIV))
	1. Touch:
		- Jesus invites Thomas to touch His wounds, saying, _“Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side.”_ and invites all of His followers to touch him, telling them he is not a ghost (see [John 20:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020&version=NIV) and [Luke 24:37-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV)).
		- The women "clasped His feet and worshiped Him," showing a physical interaction. (see [Matthew 28:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV))
	2. Sight:
		- Every account describes the disciples seeing the risen Jesus, including His physical body with wounds ([Luke 24:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV)).
	3. Hearing:
		- Jesus speaks extensively in His appearances, providing comfort, teaching, and instructions (see [Matthew 28:18–20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV) and [Luke 24:13-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV)).
	4. Eating:
		- Jesus eats broiled fish in the presence of the disciples to prove He is not a ghost (see [Luke 24:41-43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV)).
		- Jesus eats breakfast with the disciples by the Sea of Galilee (see [John 21:9-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2021&version=NIV))
	5. Extended across 40 days
		- Explicitly states the duration of 40 days during which Jesus appeared to His followers in Luke's continuation (see [Acts 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV)).

The evidence above demonstrates that the Hallucination Theory of the Disciples is effectively disproven.
### B. Paul's Transformation
1. Saul was a Jewish Rabbi who studied under the Pharisee Gamaliel and initially thought himself righteous by arresting Christians, men and women (see [Acts 22:3-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022&version=NIV), [Acts 26:9-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026&version=NIV), [Philippians 3:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203&version=NIV), and [Galatians 1:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201&version=NIV)).
	- He approved the stoning of Stephen, one of the first Christian martyrs (see [Acts 7:54-60](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207&version=NIV) and [Acts 8:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208&version=NIV)).
2. Saul on his way to Damascus was authorized by the high priest in Jerusalem to find and persecute Christians, to bring them back in Jerusalem for punishment (see [Acts 9:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209&version=NIV), [Acts 22:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022&version=NIV), and [Acts 26:9-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026&version=NIV)). 
3. Saul had met the risen Jesus on the way to Damascus who then transformed him from Saul to Paul (see [Acts 9:3-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209&version=NIV), [Acts 22:6-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022&version=NIV), and [Acts 26:12-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026&version=NIV)). 
4. Based on his writings, there is no indication that Paul experienced PTSD or guilt that could have caused Conversion Disorder, which is typically triggered by severe psychological stress, trauma, or unresolved emotional conflict.

The evidence above demonstrates that the Conversion Disorder Theory of Paul is effectively disproven.
### C. Early Church's Creed after Jesus's Resurrection
1. 3 years after Paul's conversion, he stays with Peter in Jerusalem for 15 days around AD 33-39 ( see [Galatians 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201&version=NIV))
	- Paul meets with Peter as well as James the brother of Jesus to confirm the truth of witnessing the risen Jesus and to ensure that the message he intended to share with the Gentiles was correct. The apostles affirmed Paul's message and encouraged him to spread it (see [Galatians 1:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201&version=NIV)).
	- This is where Paul would have learned the **Early Church's Creed** from Peter (see [1 Corinthians 15:3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015&version=NIV))
2. Sometime later, Paul establishes the Corinthian church a year and half before and/or during the years of Roman proconsul Gallio of Achaia in AD 51-52 (see [Acts 18: 1-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018&version=NIV) and [The Gallio Inscription](https://www.bibleplaces.com/acts18/)) 
3. Sometime after establishing the Corinthian church, Paul writes to the them citing the **Early Church's Creed** (see [1 Corinthians 15:3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015&version=NIV)).

The evidence above demonstrates that the Evolving Mythic Theory on Christianity is effectively disproven.
## 2. **L**ow Societal Status of Women and Their Testimonies
It was the Jewish societal and cultural norm to belittle and not trust women or their testimonies within especially within the 1st century. The 1st century Jewish historian Josephus and the Jewish Talmud reflect the prevailing attitudes of their time, limiting the credibility of women’s testimony, with Josephus outright dismissing it and the Talmud acknowledging small cases where it is valid but generally deeming it inferior to that of men (see [Antiquities of the Jews 4.8 15](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=J.+AJ+4.8.15&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146), [Talmud, Mishnah Rosh Hashana 1.8](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.1.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en), and [Talmud, Sotah 31b-32a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.31b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)). The Resurrection Account is unlikely to have been invented, as it runs counter to cultural expectations and legal norms of the time. This is demonstrated by:
1. Women were the first to witness the empty tomb (see [Matthew 28:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%20&version=NIV), [Mark 16:1-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016&version=NIV), [Luke 24:1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV), and [John 20:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%20&version=NIV)
2. If the early Christians were inventing narratives to support their own version of events, why not ascribe the discovery of the tomb to male witnesses who would have been received as more credible?
	- Relying on a woman's testimony was embarrassing for Jewish men at the time.

The evidence above demonstrates that the Evolving Mythic and Hoax Theories on Christianity are effectively disproven.
## 3. **I**mmediate Spread of the Good News
1. To combat the claims of the Resurrection of Jesus, the Jewish chief priests could have easily produced a body, such as another dead criminal, framing the body as Jesus's. However, the timing would have to be crucial for this to happen. By the time the Jewish leaders heard from the guards, it was likely too late to fabricate such a deception without raising suspicion. However, this did not happen as:
	- The Jewish chief priests immediately believed that the tomb was empty and they later devised a plan to claim that Jesus's body was stolen (see [Matthew 28:11-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV)). 
		- There is no record from anyone in that time claiming that the disciples had lied about the empty tomb.
1. 10 days after the 40 days of Jesus's appearances and His ascension to heaven, the disciples professed what they had seen around the Pentecost festival (see [Acts 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV), and [Acts 2:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&version=NIV)).
	- The Pentecost feast was a time when Jerusalem was filled with Jewish pilgrims across the known world (see [Acts 2: 5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&version=NIV))
		- Impostors who would have fabricated the resurrection of Jesus would have waited for a safer, less scrutinized moment to spread their claims. 
2. As a result of the disciple's preaching, thousands of people left their Jewish practices of worship at the temple, worshipping only on the Saturday Sabbath, and offering animal sacrifices, for them to start a whole new way of life (see [Acts 2: 41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&version=NIV))
	- The enemies of Jesus had the means, motive, and opportunity to discredit the apostles during this moment. If they could produce Jesus’ body, for example, it would have immediately ended the movement.

The evidence above demonstrates that the Late-Developing Legend and Hoax Theories on Christianity are effectively disproven.
## 4. **V**oluntary Sufferings
As outlined in **section III**, the apostles voluntarily suffered for proclaiming what they had seen, and most were martyred for not recanting their witnessing of the risen Jesus. They had everything to lose and nothing to gain for proclaiming what they had seen, as they faced immediate opposition.
1. People are not **willing to die** for what they **know** to be **untrue** or a **lie**. 
	- Unlike someone who sacrifices their life for a mistaken cause, the apostles were in a position to know with complete certainty if their claims were true. 
		- They claimed to have seen, touched, and conversed with Jesus after His execution and burial (see [Matthew 28:9-10, 16-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV), [Luke 24:13-53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024&version=NIV), [John 20: 19-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020&version=NIV), and [1 Corinthians 15:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015&version=NIV)). 
			- If they had intentionally invented that claim, they would have known for certain that it was not worth dying for.
	- Many zealous Jews died horribly for refusing to deny their beliefs. But the apostles of Jesus were not being asked to reject matters of faith based on events that took place centuries, if not millennia, before. They were being asked to deny something they themselves personally and directly encountered.
2. James the brother of Jesus, who initially thought Jesus was insane ([Mark 3:20-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%203&version=NIV), [John 7:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207&version=NIV)), had his life completely changed after witnessing the risen Jesus. 
	- James was then killed by the Jewish Pharisee for what he had seen. 
3. Paul, initially a violent and zealous Jewish Pharisee and persecutor of Christians, had his life completely changed by Jesus. Paul then willingly and knowingly risked his life by:
	- Contributing to Christianity's rapid growth establishing churches throughout the Roman Empire including:
		- Antioch (Syria; see [Acts 11:19-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2011&version=NIV))
		- Cyprus (see [Acts 13:4-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013&version=NIV))
		- Philippi (Macedonia; see [Acts 16:12-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016&version=NIV))
		- Thessalonica (Macedonia; see [Acts 17:1-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017&version=NIV))
		- Corinth (Achaia; see [Acts 18:1-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018&version=NIV))
		- Ephesus (Asia Minor; see [Acts 18:19-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018&version=NIV))
		- Galatia and Phrygia (Asia Minor; see [Acts 16:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016&version=NIV) and [Acts 18:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018&version=NIV)) 
		- (and many more from the Disciples)
			- The Roman Christian church potentially started after conversion of Roman Jews at the Pentecost festival (see [Acts 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&version=NIV)) as both Tacitus and Seutonius note the growth of Christianity in:
				- The time of the reigns of Emperor Claudius in 41-54 AD (see [Seutonius, Divus Claudius 25](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Suet.+Cl.+25+4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132))
				- The time of Emperor Nero's reign in 54-68 AD (see [Tacitus, Annals 15.44](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D44) and [Seutonius, Nero 16.2](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Suet.+Nero+16+2&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132)) 
	- Paul's establishment and preaching of what he had seen ultimately lead to his final arrest and death under the great persecution of Christians under Roman Emperor Nero in 62-64 AD.

The evidence above demonstrates that the Evolving Mythic and Conspiracy Theories on Christianity are effectively disproven.
## 5. **E**mpty Tomb
1. How did Christianity grow so rapidly near the tomb where Jesus was buried, if it could have been falsified so easily?
	- If Jesus's body had been lying in a tomb for a length of 50 days, His features such as hair, teeth, stature, and the wounds of crucifixion would have still been identifiable.
	- Any authorities who wanted to refute the claims of the apostles could have silenced them by taking a short stroll to the burial place of Jesus.
		- The tomb was near the site of Jesus's crucifixion, in a garden, likely near the outskirts of Jerusalem's city walls, keeping the dead safely away and adhering to Jewish law (see [John 19:41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV) and [Numbers 19:11-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2019&version=NIV)).
2. The theory of the women witnesses going to the wrong tomb is highly unlikely, as multiple Gospel accounts explicitly record the women witnessed Jesus's burial and knew the exact location before returning to it. All Gospels together align with the details of the tomb's location (see [Matthew 27:59-61](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&version=NIV), [Mark 15:46-47](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2015&version=NIV), [Luke 23:55-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023&version=NIV), [John 19:41-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV)). 
3. The theory that Joseph of Arimathea initially placed Jesus in Joseph's tomb temporarily, only to later relocate His body to a separate burial site is highly unlikely.
	- Jesus died by crucifixion in the afternoon of Preparation Day, the day before the Sabbath,  (see [Matthew 27:45-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&version=NIV), [Mark 15:33-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2015&version=NIV), [Luke 23:44-49](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023&version=NIV), [John 19:28-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV))
	- Later in the afternoon, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent Jewish Sanhedrin Council member, asked Pilate for Jesus's body to place it in his own tomb (see [Matthew 27:57-61](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&version=NIV), [Mark 15:42-47](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2015&version=NIV), [Luke 23:50-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023&version=NIV), [John 19:38-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV))
		- John additionally accounts Nicodemus, another prominent Jewish Sanhedrin Council member, helping Joseph of Arimathea wrap Jesus's body (see [John 19:39-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV)).
	- On the Sabbath, the day after Preparation day, the Jewish chief priests and Pharisees knew that Jesus was placed in Joseph of Arimathea's tomb, as they went to Pilate to request the tomb to be sealed and secured with guards due to their fear and paranoia of Jesus's resurrection (see [Matthew 27:62-66](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&version=NIV)).
		- Jesus claimed he would raise after 3 days when the Pharisees and Sadducees demanded of Him a sign (see [Matthew 16:1-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016&version=NIV), [Matthew 17:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017&version=NIV), [Matthew 20:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2020&version=NIV), [Mark 8:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208&version=NIV), [Mark 9:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209&version=NIV), [Mark 10:33-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010&version=NIV), [Luke 9:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209&version=NIV),  [Luke 9:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209&version=NIV), [Luke 18:31-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018&version=NIV), and [John 2:19-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202&version=NIV)).
		- The guards were likely Jewish Temple guards, as they immediately reported everything they had witnessed to the chief priests, who then bribed them to claim that Jesus's body had been stolen by the disciples (see [Matthew 28:11-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV)).
			- Pilate likely did not want to spend any more resources necessary to guard a Jewish Council member's tomb as he ultimately left Jesus's fate to them (see [Matthew 27:24-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&version=NIV), [Mark 15:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2015&version=NIV), [Luke 23:4-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023&version=NIV), and [John 19:12-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV)).
			- Jewish Temple guards are more likely to accept a bribe from Jewish chief priests, compared to Roman guards, as lying to Pontius Pilate would be committing treason against Caesar, and easily result in death.
		- The Jewish chief priests and Pharisees likely verified if the tomb was empty before sealing it. If the tomb was found empty at this point, Joseph of Arimathea and potentially Nicodemus likely would have been questioned, but no evidence of this exists. 
			- The Jewish chief priests likely would have had no objection to Jesus being buried in a commoner's grave, as it would still comply with Jewish burial laws (see [Deuteronomy 18:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2021&version=NIV)).
			- The other Jewish chief priests likely found Joseph of Arimathea's and Nicodemus's actions of placing Jesus in an honorable tomb unusual, which may have led them to question their motives and speculate whether they believed the body might be stolen, but no evidence of this exists either.
			- If any other Jewish or Roman authorities had relocated Jesus's body, it would have been counterproductive to their goal of preventing the spread of news about the empty tomb, especially since the Jewish chief priests were already fearful and paranoid about the possibility of Jesus raising from the dead.
4. The accusation from the Jewish Council that someone stole or took the body of Jesus implies that they believed that the tomb was actually empty (see [Matthew 28:11-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV)). 
	- The explanation for the missing body was that thieves had stolen it while the tomb guards were asleep.
		- It is highly unlikely that either Jewish Temple guards or Roman guards would fall asleep and remain unaware while someone broke the tomb’s seal, rolled away the heavy stone, took Jesus’s body, and escaped quietly, especially since the guards were prepared for such an event.
	- It is highly unlikely that Jesus's body was stolen, as it would have risked drawing significant attention from the Roman or Jewish authorities, especially those who sealed and guarded the tomb.
		- It is unlikely that Jesus's body was stolen during the day of the Sabbath, as Jewish law prohibited work, and the authorities would have been vigilant, noticing any suspicious activity (see [Exodus 20:8-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020&version=NIV), [Exodus 31:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2031&version=NIV), [Deuteronomy 5:12-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%205&version=NIV), and [Jeremiah 17:21-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2017&version=NIV)).
		- The women discovered the empty tomb either during or after the guards' report, as the guards were already gone when the women arrived (see [Matthew 27:59-61](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&version=NIV), [Mark 15:46-47](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2015&version=NIV), [Luke 23:55-56](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023&version=NIV), [John 19:41-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV)).

# VI. Conclusion
The historical reliability of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is supported by compelling evidence from both biblical and non-biblical sources. Rooted in eye-witness testimony, the Gospels demonstrate remarkable preservation, consistency, and authenticity, validated by ancient manuscripts, early church testimony, and rigorous historical methodology. These historically documented accounts alongside the non-Christian writings corroborate Jesus's existence, crucifixion, and the transformative impact of His apostles' efforts on the ancient world. 

Regarding Jesus's resurrection, all plausible explanations ultimately fall into three categories: the disciples of Jesus were either deceived, deceivers, or telling the truth. With the detailed plethora of evidence within this document, it is clear how and why the initial two scenarios are highly unlikely, leaving the truth of the apostles' testimony as the most credible explanation.

## 1. Other Writings
### A. Augustine of Hippo (Center North Africa | 398 AD)
Wrote:
- "Faustus thinks himself wonderfully clever in proving that Matthew was not the writer of this Gospel, because, when speaking of his own election, he says not, He saw me, and said to me, Follow me; but, He saw him, and said to him, Follow me. This must have neem said either in ignorance or from a design to mislead. Faustus can hardly be so ignorant as not to have read or heard that narrators, when speaking of themselves, often use a construction as if speaking of another. It is more probable that Faustus wished to bewilder those more ignorant than himself, in the hope of getting hold on not a few unacquainted with these things. It is needless to resort to other writings to quote examples of this construction from profane authors for the information of our friends, and for the refutation of Faustus."

### B. The Four Great Uncials
The four almost-complete Bibles of the Old Testament (OT) and New Testament (NT) books. All are written completely in Greek. All contain a range of most or all of the OT and NT books including apocryphal writings of both the OT (Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach/Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, 1 and 2 Maccabees) and NT. The four NT gospel accounts are included in each of the Codices. You may
#### a. Codex Vaticanus (~350 AD)
- Current Location: Vatican Library
- G. Cavallo, a renowned paleographer, proposed a mid-4th-century date, suggesting around **350 CE**, based on the script's similarity to other texts from that period (see [T.C. SKEAT ON THE DATING AND ORIGIN OF CODEX VATICANUS](_book_9789004194366_Bej.9789004189522.i-664_007-preview.pdf)).

#### b. Codex Sinaiticus (~330 AD - ~360 AD)
- Current Location: British Library in London, St. Catherine's Monastery, Leipzig University Library, and the Russian National Library in St Petersburg
- G. Cavallo, a renowned paleographer, suggested **360 CE** as the approximate date for Codex Sinaiticus. This is based on the characteristics of its uncial script, which aligns with other 4th-century manuscripts (see [T.C. SKEAT ON THE DATING AND ORIGIN OF CODEX VATICANUS](_book_9789004194366_Bej.9789004189522.i-664_007-preview.pdf)).

### C. Chester Beatty Papyri (150 AD - 350 AD)
- Current Location: Dublin, Ireland + University of Michigan
- Includes p46 (oldest mostly complete copy of Paul's Epistles)
### D. The Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs (180 CE)
This document, most likely from Christians, written in Latin, provides one of the earliest firsthand accounts of martyrdom in North Africa on top of historical reliability. It records the trial of 12 Christians from Scilli (modern Tunisia), who were executed for refusing to swear allegiance to the emperor and offer sacrifices to Roman gods. Their refusal to recant their faith and their peaceful acceptance of execution exemplify true martyrdom. (see)
