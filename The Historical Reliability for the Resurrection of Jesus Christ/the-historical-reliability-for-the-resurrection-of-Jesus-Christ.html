    <h1>The Historical Reliability for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ</h1>
    <p>
      This document presents a comprehensive exploration of the available
      evidence, both biblical and nonbiblical, for the historical reliability of
      the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is written with the
      hope of encouraging readers to thoughtfully consider the evidence paired
      with its sources, should they wish to explore further.

      <summary>I. Questions for Reflection Before Reading</summary>
        <p>1. What are you living or motivated for?</p>
        <p>2. What is the evidence that what you are living for is true?</p>
        <p>3. Is there a Creator of the Universe?</p>
          <li>
            If believed to be false, consider exploring these philosophical
            questions. Without a Creator, explore questions such as: How did the
            Universe originate? Who defines moral absolutes? Are all moral absolutes
            equally valid? Who determines their validity?
          </li>
        <p>4. Was Jesus a real historical person?</p>
        <li>
          If believed to be false, refer to section <b>IV.2</b> which examines
          non-biblical historical sources documenting Jesus from the Gospels as a
          historical figure.
        </li>
        <p>
          5. Are there any other historically reliable sources outside the New
          Testament that describe the personal life of Jesus?
        </p>
        <li>
          If so, how do they compare in reliability to the Gospel accounts? For
          any questions about assessing the reliability of historical sources,
          refer to the methodology in <b>II.6</b>, which applies universally to all
          documents.

      <summary>1. Addressing Common Questions About the Gospels</summary>

        <details>
        <summary>A. <i>Were the Gospels anonymously written?</i></summary>
          <p>
            Almost every surviving gospel manuscript with a start or finish
            includes the traditional names (see <b>Fig. 1 - Manuscript P75</b>).
            Some manuscripts, like P1 (see <b>Fig. 2 - Manuscript P1</b>), begin
            with letters from the Greek alphabet to indicate pagination, rather
            than a centered title. Additional evidence comes from P4, containing
            a blank sheet of papyrus with the centered text "Gospel According to
            Matthew" (see </b>Fig. 3 - Manuscript P4</b>). This strongly supports
            its identification as a flyleaf, and although paired with fragments
            of Luke, it appears misplaced and likely belongs to lost manuscripts
            of Matthew. This provides evidence that flyleaves, like the one in
            P4, were originally paired with Greek-letter-paginated manuscripts
            such as P1.
          </p>
          <details>
          <summary>Figure 1 - Manuscript P75</summary>
          <p>
            Here, the Greek ending <i>ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΚΑΤΑ ΛΟΥΚΑΝ</i> or <i>GOSPEL ACCORDING
            TO LUKE</i> (Lucan) denoting the end of Luke. Additionally below, the
            Greek start <i>ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΚΑΤΑ ΙΩΑΝΝΗΝ</i> or <i>GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JOHN</i>
          </p>

          <details>
          <summary>Figure 2 - Manuscript P1</summary>
          <p>
            Here, the stylized Greek "a" is the first letter. The second image
            shows the very back of this papyrus, where one can just barely make
            out the Greek letter "b". This represents pagination.

          <summary>Figure 3 - Manuscript P4</summary>
          <p>
            Here, the centered Greek most likely forms "<i>ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΚΑΤΑ
            ΜΑΘΘΑΙΟΝ</i>" or "<i>GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW</i>" where the "<i>ΚΑΤΑ
            ΜΑΘΘΑΙΟΝ</i>" are extremely fragmented. <img src="data/p4_flyleaf_of_Matthew.png" alt="p4_flyleaf_of_Matthew.png" />

          </details>

          <p>
            The Gospels were never anonymous as their authorship was backed by
            manuscript evidence (see <b>II.2</b>) and strong and consistent
            attribution of authorship by the early Christian church (see
            sections <b>II.4</b> and <b>II.5</b>).
          </p>

        </details>

        <details>
        <summary>B. <i>Were the Gospels invented or fabricated?</i></summary>
        <p>
          If the gospels were to be invented or fabricated, attributing
          'Peter' to Mark and 'James' to Luke would have been a more
          compelling and appealing choice as Mark was known to be a disciple
          of Peter and Luke was not originally one of Jesus's disciples (see
          <b>II.4.A</b>).
        </p>
          <details>
          <summary>Matthew</summary>
            <li>
              Matthew was a Jewish tax-collector for Rome, and seen as
              traitorous to other Jews (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209&version=NIV">Matthew 9:
                9-11</a>
              and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010&version=NIV">Matthew
                10:3</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
              If fabricating Matthew's gospel, why use the name of a traitor?
            </li>
          </details>

          <details>
          <summary>Mark</summary>
            <li>
              Mark was not an apostle and had abandoned Paul during the middle
              of their mission trip later causing dispute between Paul and
              Barnabas, separating them (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013&version=NIV">Acts 13:
                1-13</a>
              and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015&version=NIV">Acts 15:
                36-41</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
              Why attribute Mark, someone that brought animosity between Paul
              and Barnabas, two major leaders in spreading the Gospel, when the
              name of an eyewitness apostle Peter would have been far more
              compelling?
            </li>
          </details>

          <details>
          <summary>Luke</summary>
            <li>
              Luke was a Gentile, a non-eyewitness of Jesus, and a companion of
              Paul.
            </li>
            <li>
              Why attribute an outsider when the name of an eyewitness apostle
              would have been far more compelling?
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, Luke had dedicated his Gospel account specifically
              for a "Theophilus" , so there was not a mystery to who wrote Luke's
              Gospel (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&version=NIV">Luke
                1:1-4</a>
              and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV">Acts
                1:1-3</a>).
            </li>
          </details>

          <p>
          If the goal were to boost credibility of fabricated Gospels, one
          would naturally choose prominent names, as evidenced by the
          apocryphal gospels (e.g., <i>The Gospel of Peter</i>, <i>The Gospel of
          Thomas</i>), which were not accepted by the early Christian church (see
          sections <b>II.4</b> and <b>II.5</b>).
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            C. <i>Are the Gospels Less Historically Reliable Given Their
            Differences From One Another?</i>
          </summary>
          <p>
            It is uncommon for witnesses of the same event to agree on every
            detail including the smallest details. Perfect agreement can raise
            suspicion of dishonesty or collaboration. For example, if we are
            only given two accounts.
          </p>
            <details>
            <summary>Example:</summary>
            <p>
              Imagine two witnesses describing a famous speech by Dr. Martin
              Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington. One witness says, "<i>He
              was wearing a <b>dark</b> suit, and the crowd erupted in applause when
              he said '<b>I have a dream</b>.'</i>" The other says, "<i>He wore a
              <b>black</b> suit, and people cheered loudly after he said '<b>I have a
              dream today</b>.'</i>"
            </p>
            <p>
              The slight differences calling the suit "dark" versus "black" and
              phrasing of the "I have a dream" seem natural and reflect individual
              perceptions. If instead, both witnesses gave identical accounts,
              down to every word and detail, like, "<i>Dr. King wore a black suit
              and the crowd erupted in applause exactly when he said 'I have a
              dream today.'</i>", it might feel rehearsed or suspicious, as real-life
              memory usually is not that perfect.
            </p>
            </details>
          <li>
            In courts of law, two accounts of an event do not need to be
            perfectly identical for them both to be true.
          </li>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            D. <i>Were the Gospel Writers Exchanging Ideas or Copying Another's
            Work?</i>
          </summary>
          <p>
            If Mark's Gospel is based on the testimony of Peter (see
            <b>II.4.A</b>), there's nothing remotely implausible about Matthew
            using it as a source for his account. Matthew could have relied on
            this source especially for any events at which Matthew himself was
            not present, such as the early days of Jesus's ministry (see
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203&version=NIV">Matthew
              3-8</a>)
            or the events of Jesus's passion and death, which Matthew did not
            witness because he had fled the scene (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026&version=NIV">Matthew
              26-28</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            History gives us other examples of eyewitnesses who relied on other
            people's testimony when composing biographies of their own teachers.
            For example,
          </p>
          <li>
            When writing his account of the death of Socrates, the ancient
            Greek writer Xenophon (who was a disciple of Socrates) used the
            "reports" (Greek exengelle) of another disciple named Hermogenes
            (see <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0212">Xenophon Apology,
              1.2</a>).
          </li>
          <li>
            The reason was that Xenophon was not present at the trial and
            death of Socrates, whereas Hermogenes was.
          </li>

          <p>
            As of writing this document, there are over 5,800 Greek New

            these 5,800 manuscripts, the Gospels contain the majority of these
            at over 2,400. Scholars such as Daniel Wallace, founder of the
            CSNTM, have meticulously analyzed thousands of the oldest Greek
            manuscript copies, and found that the overwhelming majority of
            textual variations are minor, often involving spelling differences
            or word order, with no significant impact on meaning (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ5cgQUJnrI" target="_blank">Daniel

          <li>Luke ~ 85 AD</li>

          <details>

            <li>
              Jesus is also revealing to His audience that history is about to
              repeat itself, as Jerusalem was already destroyed by Babylon in
              586 BC (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%2025&version=NIV" target="_blank">2 Kings

            <summary>b. Exposing the Anti-Prophetic Theory</summary>
            <p>
              The <i>Anti-Prophetic</i> theory claims that Jesus could have never
              prophesied the coming devastation of Jerusalem in such great
              detail.
            </p>
            <li>
              If the Gospels were written in the scholarly accepted dates,
              the destruction of Jerusalem would have had already happened in 70
              AD.
            </li>
            <li>
              Why would Matthew or Mark add for his audience to pray that the
              desolation would not take place on the sabbath (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 24:
              20</a>)
              or in winter (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2013&version=NIV" target="_blank">Mark 13:
              18</a>)
              if the destruction happened in the Summer after a traditional
              Jewish sabbath?
            </li>
            <li>
              Why would Luke add a warning for his audience not to enter into

              <b>This does not make any sense for anyone reading the documents at
              the proposed dates</b>, and the early Christian church would have
              easily caught and denied these as fake accounts (see sections

                <p>
                  Due to the Gallio archeological finding (see <a href="https://www.bibleplaces.com/acts18/" target="_blank">The Gallio
                  Inscription</a>) we can date
                  Paul's last letter (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201&version=NIV" target="_blank">2
                  Timothy</a>)
                  to shortly before his death while he was under trial, during the
                  reign of Roman Emperor Nero's great Christian Persecution (see
                  <b>III.2.A</b>). The early Church father's believed that Paul was
                  beheaded in Rome, under the government of Nero (see <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250102.htm" target="_blank">Eusebius of Ceasarea, Church History.II.25</a>

                </p>
                  <li>
                    Luke does not mention Paul's death even though the evidence
                    supports he was Paul's travel companion throughout his journeys
                    (see
                    <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV" target="_blank">Acts</a>).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Acts 20 - Acts 28</b> follows closely the progress of Paul's
                    trial. The narrative then abruptly ends before the trial even
                    happens (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020&version=NIV" target="_blank">Acts

                  </li>
                <p>
                  This is unlike Luke, giving great detail about Jesus's trial and
                  Paul's sufferings before his death. Why would he not detail the
                  events of Paul's trial? <b>The evidence supports that the trial had
                  not happened yet dating Acts before 64 AD and before the

              Because of the Gallio inscription in 51-52 AD, Paul's preaching at

              It is evident that Matthew likely had used Mark's Gospel as a
              reference, and if Matthew was likely written before 51-52 AD (see
              <b>section II.3.B.b</b>), then Mark also was likely written before
              51-52 AD.

            <p>
              With the described evidence, one can conclude <b>Acts</b> was likely
              written before 64 AD. Luke wrote <b>Acts</b> sometime after his own
              Gospel (<b>Luke</b>). If <b>Luke</b> possibly used the Gospels of
              <b>Matthew</b> and <b>Mark</b>, that means they were written before the
              Gospel of <b>Luke</b>. John was likely written after the other Gospel
              accounts, but noting the death of Peter with the present tense of
              Jerusalem suggests that he wrote in between these two events.
              Therefore, the likely dates of when the gospels were written are
              as follows (the "~" denotes "approximately"):
            </p>
              <li>Matthew ~ before 64 AD (potentially before 51-52 AD see <b>II.3.B.b</b>)</li>
              <li>Mark ~ before 64 AD (potentially before 51-52 AD - see <b>II.3.B.c</b>)</li>
              <li>Luke ~ before 64 AD</li>

          4. Testimonies and Relentlessness of Authenticity From the Early
          Christian Church on Who Wrote the Gospels
        </summary>
        <p>
          The early Christian church fathers universally acknowledged the four
          named Gospels as being written by their respective names. If the
          Gospels were anonymous, it is not reasonable to assume them
          circulating around the Roman Empire for almost 100 years could somehow
          at some point be attributed to exactly the same authors by scribes
          throughout the world during the 1st and 2nd centuries. This argument
          is exemplified as there existed significant debate as to who wrote the
          Epistle to the Hebrews among the early Church fathers (see <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0211.htm" target="_blank">Clement of
          Alexandria's Fragments - Comments On the First Epistle of
          Peter</a>, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2501.htm" target="_blank">Eusebius of
          Caesarea's Church History.3.3, 6.14, 6.20,

          Carthage's On
          Modesty.20</a>). There
          existed no debate regarding the authorship of the four Gospels among
          the early Christian church, unlike their debates regarding other
          writings, such as the Letter to the Hebrews.

        <summary>6. Testing the Historicity of the Gospels</summary>
        <p>
          Tests must be created in order to be used for any document that claims
          to be historical. Their goal should be to carefully and fairly examine
          historical documents to uncover unbiased truth. These tests are listed
          below
        </p>
        <p>
          1. <b>Literary Style</b>: Is the literary style of the document fairytale
          such as "Once upon a time, in the land of Narnia", or is it historical
          narrative including high witness reporting, i.e. "At this time, at
          this place, with these people around"?
        </p>
        <p>
          2. <b>Internal Consistency</b>: Are there contradictions within the text
          that point to massive confusion on the part of the author?
        </p>
        <li>
          Universal, Divergent, and Perspective details from documents, not
          contradicting one another, but containing different details note
          authenticity on the part of the authors.
        </li>
        <li>Multiple historical perspectives help a historical claim's accuracy.</li>
        <p>
          3. <b>Archeological Evidence</b>: Does the document state for example
          "Augusto floated a boat 100 cubits above the city of Atlantis?" or
          does the document contain specific and hard details of specific people
          and geographical landmarks or places that can be historically verified
          that others in the time and place otherwise would not know if they had
          not observed these in that time?
        </p>
        <p>
          4. <b>Manuscript Evidence</b>: Do older documents compared with much
          later copies of them agree with only infinitesimal differences?
          Meaning, the differences between manuscripts are extremely small and
          unimportant, proving that despite massive gaps of time, the
          manuscripts are overwhelmingly consistent with one another.

          <summary>A. Testing the Historicity of the Spider-Man Novels</summary>
          <p>
            Here is an example of using these tests on Spider-Man novels if
            found 2000 years into the future:
          </p>
          <p><b>Literary Style - <span style="color: #D32F2F;">FAIL</span></b></p>
          <p>
            The documents of Spiderman do not represent historical
            eyewitness-style reporting, but more so of story telling.
          </p>
          <p><b>Internal Consistency - <span style="color: #D32F2F;">FAIL</span></b></p>
          <p>
            While the internal consistency may be strong within short arcs, the
            larger canon contains purposeful contradictions (i.e. specific arcs,
            series, intentional reboots, or alternate timelines) that indicate a
            fictional and evolving story, rather than a single, unified
            historical narrative.
          </p>
          <p><b>Archeological Evidence - <span style="color: #D32F2F;">FAIL</span></b></p>
          <p>
            Archeologists 2000 years into the future would find no other
            historical evidence of people named "Green Goblin" or "Doctor
            Octopus" as well as no corporations with hundreds of workers like
            "Oscorp" or the "Daily Bugle".
          </p>
          <p><b>Manuscript Evidence - <span style="color: #D32F2F;">FAIL</span></b></p>
          <p>
            While there might be remarkable consistency in certain elements of
            Spider-Man’s story, the changes across time would indicate a work of
            fiction rather than an attempt to document real events. For example,
            take a look at first issues of <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> from 1963,
            and compare it to <i>Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man</i> from 2011. Both
            documents include a character named Spider-Man who has great powers,
            but one is named Peter Parker and the other is Miles Morales! Both
            of which also have drastically different origin stories and cultural
            settings.

            B. Testing the Historicity of Martin Luther King Jr's Speeches and
            Letters
          </summary>
          <p>
            Here is an example of using these tests on Martin Luther King Jr's
            speeches and letters if found 2000 years into the future:
          </p>
          <p><b>Literary Style - <span style="color: #388E3C;">PASS</span></b></p>

          <p>
            The style of MLK Jr.’s speeches and letters, such as the "I Have a
            Dream" speech or "Letter from Birmingham Jail," is firmly rooted in
            historical narrative and persuasive argumentation. These documents
            reference real events, people, and struggles of the Civil Rights
            Movement in 20th-century America.
          </p>
          <p><b>Internal Consistency - <span style="color: #388E3C;">PASS</span></b></p>
          <p>
            Across King’s speeches and letters, there is a remarkable
            consistency in themes and messages. He consistently advocates for
            nonviolence, racial equality, and justice. Any potential divergences
            (such as minor wording differences between recordings and manuscript
            transcriptions) would enhance their authenticity rather than detract
            from it.
          </p>
          <p><b>Archeological Evidence - <span style="color: #388E3C;">PASS</span></b></p>
          <p>
            Archeologists 2000 years into the future could uncover physical
            evidence of King’s speeches and letters provide detailed references
            to real, verifiable events, locations, monuments, jail records, news
            articles, and preserved media from the 20th century, firmly
            grounding them in historical reality.
          </p>
          <p><b>Manuscript Evidence - <span style="color: #388E3C;">PASS</span></b></p>
          <p>
            King’s letters and speeches have been preserved with numerous
            written manuscripts, audio recordings, and video footage. Comparing
            early drafts to the latest draft we have today reveals overwhelming
            consistency. Minor differences (e.g., editorial choices) would be
            insignificant to the overall meaning and content.

            Given these tests and their application to the previous examples,
            this section implores the reader to use these tests on the Gospels
            of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John to evaluate their historical
            reliability. If these particular tests are deemed insufficient,
            alternative criteria should be developed to rigorously assess the
            authenticity of any document. The goal of these tests should remain
            to be the careful and fair examination of historical texts to
            uncover unbiased truth.

      <summary>III. Were the Apostles Truly Martyred?</summary>
      <p>
        The Disciples passed their lives in labors, dangers, and sufferings,
        voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they
        delivered, and solely in consequence of their accounts. The early
        Christian church was under heavy persecution and the apostles knew that
        suffering and death were around every corner for them, but that didn't
        stop them from spreading what they had seen (see
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV" target="_blank">Acts</a>).
        They rejoiced in knowing that suffering and death were around the corner
        for them. This section documents below that the execution of Christians
        happened because they either were Christians or did not renounce their
        Christian faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-Christian sources like Josephus, Tacitus, and Suetonius provide
        indirect or circumstantial evidence for the persecution and deaths of
        early Christians. While these sources rarely name individuals beyond
        James the brother of Jesus, they corroborate the historical reality of
        violence and persecution from both the Jews and Romans against the early
        Christian figures and communities.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>1. Josephus on James the Brother of Jesus | 92-93 AD</summary>
        <p>
          Josephus the Jewish Historian writes how James the brother of Jesus
          Christ is killed by the High Priest Ananus unjustifiably.
        </p>
        <li>
          "...brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ,
          whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an
          accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to
          be stoned..." (see <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D20%3Asection%3D197" target="_blank">Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews
          20.197-202</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          This demonstrates the sincerity of those who witnessed Jesus's
          resurrection, as they were unafraid to tell the news of what they had
          seen.
        </li>
        <li>
          This accredits historical reliability to the Gospels stating that
          the Sadducees and Pharisees unjustly gave anyone charges they deemed a
          nuisance.

        <summary>2. Pliny the Younger | 110-113 AD</summary>
        <p>
          In his letters to Emperor Trajan, Pliny describes interrogating
          Christians in Bithynia. While he does not name specific apostles or
          disciples, he notes that some Christians were executed for refusing to
          renounce their faith. This aligns with broader traditions of martyrdom
          involving early Christian leaders (see <a href="data/Pliny.pdf" target="_blank">Pliny the Younger, Letters 10.96-97</a>).

          disciples, he notes the expulsion of Christians from Rome under
          Claudius and Nero's persecution of Christians. His account of Nero’s
          reign reflects the widespread persecution and execution of Christian
          leaders, including likely some of the apostles (see <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Suet.+Cl.+25+4&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0132#note4" target="_blank">The Lives of the

        <summary>1. Idea of Crucifying the Jewish Messiah</summary>
        <p>
          It was an extremely offensive idea of a crucified messiah to
          1st-century Jews. No law-observing Jew would have made up the idea of
          a crucified messiah. If any non-religious Jews existed, they likely
          would not imagine this due the punishment they may receive. We can
          conclude this by the writings of the Old Testament Law (see

            1. 3 years after Paul's conversion, he stays with Peter in Jerusalem
            for 15 days around AD 33-39 ( see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201&version=NIV" target="_blank">Galatians

          <li>
            Paul meets with Peter as well as James the brother of Jesus to
            confirm the truth of witnessing the risen Jesus and to ensure that
            the message he intended to share with the Gentiles was correct. The
            apostles affirmed Paul's message and encouraged him to spread it
            (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201&version=NIV" target="_blank">Galatians
            1:18-19</a>).

        </summary>
        <p>
          It was the Jewish societal and cultural norm to belittle and not trust
          women or their testimonies within especially within the 1st century.
          The 1st century Jewish historian Josephus and the Jewish Talmud
          reflect the prevailing attitudes of their time, limiting the
          credibility of women’s testimony, with Josephus outright dismissing it
          and the Talmud acknowledging small cases where it is valid but
          generally deeming it inferior to that of men (see <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=J.+AJ+4.8.15&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146" target="_blank">Antiquities of the

          31b-32a</a>).
          The Resurrection Account is unlikely to have been invented, as it runs
          counter to cultural expectations and legal norms of the time. This is
          demonstrated by:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Women were the first to witness the empty tomb (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%20&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew
          28:1-7</a>,

        </p>
        <p>
          2. If the early Christians were inventing narratives to support their
          own version of events, why not ascribe the discovery of the tomb to
          male witnesses who would have been received as more credible?
        </p>
        <li>
          Relying on a woman's testimony was embarrassing for Jewish men at
          the time.

        <p>
          1. To combat the claims of the Resurrection of Jesus, the Jewish chief
          priests could have easily produced a body, such as another dead
          criminal, framing the body as Jesus's. However, the timing would have
          to be crucial for this to happen. By the time the Jewish leaders heard
          from the guards, it was likely too late to fabricate such a deception
          without raising suspicion. However, this did not happen as:
        </p>
        <li>
          The Jewish chief priests immediately believed that the tomb was
          empty and they later devised a plan to claim that Jesus's body was
          stolen (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew
          28:11-15</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          There is not any historical record claiming that the disciples had lied about the empty tomb.
        </li>
        <p>
          2. 10 days after the 40 days of Jesus's appearances and His ascension
          to heaven, the disciples professed what they had seen around the
          Pentecost festival (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201&version=NIV" target="_blank">Acts
          1:3</a>,
          and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&version=NIV" target="_blank">Acts
          2:1</a>).
        </p>
        <li>
          The Pentecost feast was a time when Jerusalem was filled with Jewish
          pilgrims across the known world (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&version=NIV" target="_blank">Acts 2:
          5-6</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          Impostors who would have fabricated the resurrection of Jesus would
          have waited for a safer, less scrutinized moment to spread their
          claims.
        </li>
        <p>
          3. As a result of the disciple's preaching, thousands of people left
          their Jewish practices of worship at the temple, worshipping only on
          the Saturday Sabbath, and offering animal sacrifices, for them to
          start a whole new way of life (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&version=NIV" target="_blank">Acts 2:
          41</a>)
        </p>
        <li>
          The enemies of Jesus had the means, motive, and opportunity to
          discredit the apostles during this moment. If they could produce
          Jesus’ body, for example, it would have immediately ended the
          movement.
        </li>
        <p>

          As outlined in <b>section III</b>, the apostles voluntarily suffered for
          proclaiming what they had seen, and most were martyred for not
          recanting their witnessing of the risen Jesus. They had everything to
          lose and nothing to gain for proclaiming what they had seen, as they
          faced immediate opposition.

          Unlike someone who sacrifices their life for a mistaken cause, the

        </li>

          If they had intentionally invented that claim, they would have known
          for certain that it was not worth dying for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many zealous Jews died horribly for refusing to deny their beliefs.
          But the apostles of Jesus were not being asked to reject matters of
          faith based on events that took place centuries, if not millennia,
          before. They were being asked to deny something they themselves
          personally and directly encountered.

          1. How did Christianity grow so rapidly near the tomb where Jesus was

        <details>
        <summary>Factors for Falsifiability</summary>
          <li>
            If Jesus's body had been lying in a tomb for a length of 50 days,
            His features such as hair, teeth, stature, and the wounds of
            crucifixion would have still been identifiable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any authorities who wanted to refute the claims of the apostles
            could have silenced them by taking a short stroll to the burial place
            of Jesus.
          </li>
          <li>
            The tomb was near the site of Jesus's crucifixion, in a garden,
            likely near the outskirts of Jerusalem's city walls, keeping the dead
            safely away and adhering to Jewish law (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019&version=NIV" target="_blank">John
            19:41</a>

          2. The theory of the women witnesses going to the wrong tomb is highly
          unlikely, as multiple Gospel accounts explicitly record the women
          witnessed Jesus's burial and knew the exact location before returning
          to it. All Gospels together align with the details of the tomb's
          location (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew

          Joseph's tomb temporarily, only to later relocate His body to a
          separate burial site is highly unlikely.

          <summary>Reasoning for Jewish Temple Guards</summary>
            <li>
              The guards were likely Jewish Temple guards, as they immediately
              reported everything they had witnessed to the chief priests, who then
              bribed them to claim that Jesus's body had been stolen by the
              disciples (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew
              28:11-14</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
              Pilate likely did not want to spend any more resources necessary to
              guard a Jewish Council member's tomb as he ultimately left Jesus's
              fate to them (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew
              27:24-25</a>,

            </li>
            <li>
              Jewish Temple guards are more likely to accept a bribe from Jewish
              chief priests, compared to Roman guards, as lying to Pontius Pilate
              would be committing treason against Caesar, and easily result in
              death.

          <summary>The Likelihood of Not Checking the Tomb</summary>
            <li>
              The Jewish chief priests and Pharisees likely verified if the tomb
              was empty before sealing it. If the tomb was found empty at this
              point, Joseph of Arimathea and potentially Nicodemus likely would have
              been questioned, but no evidence of this exists.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Jewish chief priests likely would have had no objection to Jesus
              being buried in a commoner's grave, as it would still comply with
              Jewish burial laws (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2021&version=NIV" target="_blank">Deuteronomy
              18:22-23</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
              The other Jewish chief priests likely found Joseph of Arimathea's
              and Nicodemus's actions of placing Jesus in an honorable tomb unusual,
              which may have led them to question their motives and speculate
              whether they believed the body might be stolen, but no evidence of
              this exists either.
            <li>
              If any other Jewish or Roman authorities had relocated Jesus's body,
              it would have been counterproductive to their goal of preventing the
              spread of news about the empty tomb, especially since the Jewish chief
              priests were already fearful and paranoid about the possibility of
              Jesus raising from the dead.

        </details>

        <p>
          4. The accusation from the Jewish Council that someone stole or took
          the body of Jesus implies that they believed that the tomb was
          actually empty (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew
          28:11-15</a>).

        <details>
        <summary>The Likelihood of Stealing the Body of Jesus</summary>
          <li>
            The explanation for the missing body was that thieves had stolen it
            while the tomb guards were asleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is highly unlikely that either Jewish Temple guards or Roman
            guards would fall asleep and remain unaware while someone broke the
            tomb’s seal, rolled away the heavy stone, took Jesus’s body, and
            escaped quietly, especially since the guards were prepared for such an
            event.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is highly unlikely that Jesus's body was stolen, as it would have
            risked drawing significant attention from the Roman or Jewish
            authorities, especially those who sealed and guarded the tomb.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is unlikely that Jesus's body was stolen during the day of the
            Sabbath, as Jewish law prohibited work, and the authorities would have
            been vigilant, noticing any suspicious activity (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2020&version=NIV" target="_blank">Exodus
            20:8-11</a>,

      <summary>VI. Conclusion</summary>
      <p>
        The historical reliability of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus
        Christ is supported by compelling evidence from both biblical and
        non-biblical sources. Rooted in eye-witness testimony, the Gospels
        demonstrate remarkable preservation, consistency, and authenticity,
        validated by ancient manuscripts, early church testimony, and rigorous
        historical methodology. These historically documented accounts alongside
        the non-Christian writings corroborate Jesus's existence, crucifixion,
        and the transformative impact of His apostles' efforts on the ancient
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding Jesus's resurrection, all plausible explanations ultimately
        fall into three categories: the disciples of Jesus were either deceived,
        deceivers, or telling the truth. With the detailed plethora of evidence
        within this document, it is clear how and why the initial two scenarios
        are highly unlikely, leaving the truth of the apostles' testimony as the
        most credible explanation.

              "Faustus thinks himself wonderfully clever in proving that Matthew
              was not the writer of this Gospel, because, when speaking of his own
              election, he says not, He saw me, and said to me, Follow me; but, He
              saw him, and said to him, Follow me. This must have neem said either
              in ignorance or from a design to mislead. Faustus can hardly be so
              ignorant as not to have read or heard that narrators, when speaking
              of themselves, often use a construction as if speaking of another.
              It is more probable that Faustus wished to bewilder those more
              ignorant than himself, in the hope of getting hold on not a few
              unacquainted with these things. It is needless to resort to other
              writings to quote examples of this construction from profane authors

          <summary>D. The Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs (180 CE)</summary>
          <p>
            This document, most likely from Christians, written in Latin,
            provides one of the earliest firsthand accounts of martyrdom in
            North Africa on top of historical reliability. It records the trial
            of 12 Christians from Scilli (modern Tunisia), who were executed for
            refusing to swear allegiance to the emperor and offer sacrifices to
            Roman gods. Their refusal to recant their faith and their peaceful
            acceptance of execution exemplify true martyrdom.
